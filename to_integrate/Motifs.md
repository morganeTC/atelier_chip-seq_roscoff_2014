ChIP-seq annotation and visualization
=====================================

### Global Objective
Given a set of ChIP-seq peaks, 

1. Fetch the peak sequences from UCSC.
2. Discover exceptional motifs in the peak sequences, according to two complementary criteria: over-representation or position biases, and predict the factor binding motifs that may bind to these peaks.
3. Cluster the discovered motifs with the matching motifs from a reference database in order to get a synthetic view of the results. 


### Data set

For this practical session, the ChIP-seq data and peaks related to following publication will be used: “GATA3 acts upstream of FOXA1 in mediating ESR1 binding by shaping enhancer accessibility.”, [Theodorou _et al_](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23172872).
